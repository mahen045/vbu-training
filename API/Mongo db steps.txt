1. Install Mongo DB
	If MongoDB is not already installed on your system, 
	download it from MongoDB official website and follow the installation instructions.
	
2. Start MongoDB server
		After installation, you need to start the MongoDB server (also called mongod):
		run "mongod" on command prompt
		
3. Connect to mongodb shell
		run "mongo" on command prompt
			
4. Create database:
		In MongoDB, databases are created automatically when you insert data.
		However, you can switch to a database and then create collections within it.
		To switch to a new database (if it doesn't exist, it will be created once you add data):
		 <use mydatabase>
		 
5. Create a collection:
		Collections in MongoDB are similar to tables in relational databases,
		and documents are similar to rows. You can create a collection and insert 
		documents into it with the following commands.
		Insert a document into the users collection (which will be created if it doesnâ€™t exist):
		
		db.users.insertOne({
			name: "John Doe",
			email: "john@example.com",
			age: 30
		})
		This will insert a single document (record) into the users collection.
		
Insert multiple documents into the users collection:

		db.users.insertMany([
			{ name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com", age: 25 },
			{ name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com", age: 35 }
		])
		
6. To check the documents in the collection, you can use the find command:	
		db.users.find().pretty()

7. Update documents:
	You can update a document using the updateOne or updateMany methods:
	db.users.updateOne(
		{ name: "John Doe" }, 
		{ $set: { age: 31 } }
	)
	
8 Delete document
		db.users.deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" })

		db.users.deleteMany({})
		
9. Show all databases and collections
		show dbs
		show collections
